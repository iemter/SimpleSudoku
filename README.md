# SimpleSudoku
A very simple sudoku app using QT and C++ 

# General
The games itself are generated using a part of a [kaggle sudoku dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bryanpark/sudoku) containing the games and solutions. Currently there is no way to save a game, so whenever the window is closed and the application quits, all progress is lost. 

During startup, a random game is chosen from all available games. Each entered digit it compared to the solution.
